# Full-Stack Node.js Project

This project is a full-stack application with a frontend and a backend built using **Node.js**. The frontend is built with modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js) and the backend is powered by **Express** on Node.js.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is responsible for the user interface and communicates with the backend via API calls.

### Frontend Installation

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Frontend

To start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will typically be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), depending on the framework you're using.

---

## Backend

The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, and it exposes APIs to interact with the frontend.

### Backend Installation

1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Backend

To start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will typically be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) or any port defined in your environment variables.

```

## Environment Variables

Both frontend and backend require environment variables for proper configuration.

### Frontend

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` folder (if it doesn't exist) and add the following:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Backend

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder (if it doesn't exist) and add the following:

```env
PORT=5000
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb
JWT_SECRET=mySecretKey
```

---

## Deployment

For deployment, we recommend the following:

1. **Frontend Deployment**: You can deploy the frontend on platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or any static hosting provider.
   
2. **Backend Deployment**: The backend can be deployed using services like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), or [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

You may need to adjust API URLs and other settings based on your production environment.
